Understanding Computation
=================================

I'm working through Tom Stuart's book [Understanding Computation](http://computationbook.com/) and, to really understand things, recording it here.

If you're having thoughts about forking or doing anything with this repository, then I urge you to check out Tom's instead, https://github.com/tomstuart/computationbook.
